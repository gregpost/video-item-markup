# video-item-markup
It uses QGraphicsVideoItem and MyGraphicsView to display and interact with the video. The Document class stores the current zoom level, frame duration, and the list of annotations. MainWindow provides controls for opening files, navigating between frames, zooming, and clearing annotations.  

This project doesn't build yet. It's just a code draft for now.
